Nota about the form

This fork is used to implement the interoperability between TestNG and Tycho.
This feature is caputred by:
http://jira.opensymphony.com/browse/TESTNG-455
https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/TYCHO-424

Welcome to TestNG

Please note that even though the .zip distribution contains the TestNG sources,
you will not be able to build the software with them because we decided
not to include the external jar files in order to keep the size down.

If you want to build TestNG, please read the instructions at http://testng.org.
