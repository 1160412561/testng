# Two different POMs are needed to build TestNG with Maven because it's not
# allowed to have circular dependencies.
# - pom.xml defines the project version "n-SNAPSHOT", builds, jars and deploys (but doesn't
# run the tests).
# - pom-test.xml declares a test dependency on "n-SNAPSHOT", which it will find
# in the local repository (~/.m2/repository). All it does then is run the tests.
